## What is AjaxSyncSolution?
AjaxSyncSolution is a high performance and reliable solution for synchronizing web pages with their servers. We support PHP as a good back-end for our solution by providing a dedicated helper package, and our front-end part helper classes wrote in JavaScript native language.


## Why should I use AjaxSyncSolution?
* **EASEY TO USE** - Implementing reliable interfaces to JQuery Ajax and managing requests in backend are a little bit difficult. There are many guides and tutorials to do it, but the packages they are doing what we exactly do is hard to find, and almost everyone spending so much time to creating their own helper packages.

* **ADVANCED FUNCTIONALITY** - We did our best to creating a better tool and helper classes for providing a better synchronization system for websites.

* **FREE** - Best of all, AjaxSyncSolution is **free**.
